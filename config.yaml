  ## Backup targets ##
  #
  # Partial names are allowed, it doesn't have to be exact
  # Empty array (the default) means "everything in this category"
  # null or an array containing only null means "nothing in this category"

  # Array of user dialogs to backup
  backup_users: [

  ]
  
  # Array of group dialogs to backup
  backup_groups: [
  
  ]
  
  # Array of broadcast channels to backup
  # Disabled by default because for the moment it will fail unless telegram-cli
  # is built from their test branch (feature tested with tg revision c69f2a2)
  backup_channels: null


  ## Output options ##

  # Formatters export the JSON output to a different format
  # To enable a formatter, uncomment it along with all of its options
  # If no formatters are enabled, only JSON files are produced
  formatters:
  #  plaintext:
  #    date_format: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
  #  bare:
  #  pisg:

  # Target directory for the backup files
  # It his is a relative path it will be relative to the script's directory
  backup_dir: './output'

  # Maximum number of messages to backup for each target (0 means unlimited)
  backlog_limit: 0

  # At the time of writing, telegram-cli does not properly detect audio/video
  # These will be recognized as documents instead
  # Stickers are also considered documents
  download_media:
    photo: false
    document: false
    audio: false
    video: false

  # False to reference downloaded files in the telegram-cli cache
  # True to copy downloaded media to a dedicated directory per dialog
  copy_media: false

  # True to delete media files from telegram-cli cache right after downloading
  # Effectively turns copy_media into move_media
  # Beware: this will cause media files to be redownloaded every backup run
  delete_media: false

  # When a user's real name is formatted, include their last name if possible
  display_last_name: true


  ## Technical options ##

  # Address of the machine you are running telegram-cli on
  # If this is not localhost telegram-cli must be invoked with --accept-any-tcp
  tg_host: 'localhost'

  # Should match the port passed to telegram-cli with the -P option
  tg_port: 9009

  # Number of messages to request in one chunk
  chunk_size: 100

  # Time in seconds to wait between requesting chunks
  chunk_delay: 1.0

  # Time in seconds to wait before considering a request stuck (0 = infinite)
  chunk_timeout: 10

  # Time in seconds to wait before considering a download stuck (0 = infinite)
  # Beware: setting this nonzero may cause a dialog backup to be canceled
  # because of a large media file
  media_timeout: 0


  ## Advanced behavior settings ##

  # Enables incremental backups (progress is tracked in <outdir>/progress.json)
  # Setting this to false will force a complete re-run of the backup every time
  track_progress: true

  # Replacement string for the characters in dialog names which are potentially
  # problematic in filenames
  # You can set this to '' if the dialog names are unique enough
  character_substitute: '_'

  # Skip messages if their text matches this Ruby regex
  # Example: '/forbidden|words/i'
  filter_regex: null
